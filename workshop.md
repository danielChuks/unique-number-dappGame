# 2.0 Workshop: Unique Number Game

In this workshop i would work you through the details of my submitted Hack game "unique number game".

This workshop, takes into consideration of the fact that you have indeed complete the reach tutorial.

We assume that youâ€™ll go through this workshop in a directory named `~/reach/workshop-unique-number-dappgame:`
```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/reach/workshop-unique-number-dappgame
```

And that you have a copy of Reach installed in ~/reach so you can write
```bash
  $../reach version
```
This should run reach successfuly

It best to start off by initialzing your reach program by runing the following:
```bash
  $.../reach init
```

# 2.0.1 Problem Analysis

The first step to implementing any application or provide any solution to a problem is to do what we call problem analytics.
This problem analyitics entails defining the general scope of the issue and how we intend to sove the problem this problem with our application.
You should also write your own answers in your Reach program (index.rsh) using a comment. /* Remember comments are written like this. */


      Who is involved in this application?

      What information are they to provide at the start of the game

      How do we avoid cheating from both parties

      What funds change ownership in the game should there be a draw or a winner 

**Stop!** Write down the problem description as a comment 

      My game involves two player: one player starts the game another enact or join the game 

      Creator of the game stipulate the amount or price they want to set for a each round of the game and the other player accept the said amount staked by the creator

      Creator won't know any other information about the game so also the other player.

      Express rule of the game are outlined to the players and what they need too win is clear.

      The funds change ownership when there is a winner
